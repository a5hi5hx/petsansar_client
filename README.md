# PetSansar Server

Developed the PetSansar mobile app using Flutter, allowing users to browse and purchase pets and pet-related products, featuring user profiles, favorites, and notifications, integrated via a backend API for product information and user authentication. Additionally, created a Node.js server with a RESTful API for CRUD operations, enhancing efficiency with Express.js and Mongoose, and deployed it on Cyclic and MongoDB Atlas, including an admin dashboard for managing shop details.
